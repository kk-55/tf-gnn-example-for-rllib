    The observation is a graph (resp. its state) which consists of at least one
    node set (having some features) and optionally an arbitrary number of edge
    sets (having some features) and also some (global) graph context features.

    Note that the env returns as observation the current graph state which
    serves as input for a TF-GNN model (see TFGraphObsModel).
    The observation space is of type `ray.rllib.utils.spaces.graph.Graph`.
